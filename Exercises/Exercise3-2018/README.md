Solutions to the data-wrangling exercise described in [Exercise3.pdf](https://burtmonroe.github.io/SoDA501/Exercise3-2018/Exercise3.pdf). 

The input to the exercise is the raw data on 2016 Centre County, PA, precinct level votes found in ["CentreCountyPrecinctResults2016GeneralElection.txt"](https://burtmonroe.github.io/SoDA501/Exercise3-2018/CentreCountyPrecinctResults2016GeneralElection.txt), which were retrieved from [http://centrecountypa.gov/Index.aspx?NID=802](http://centrecountypa.gov/Index.aspx?NID=802).

The exercise asks you to extract the data on votes cast by precinct in statewide elections, and process them into a new table with precinct level data on total votes, Democratic share of two-party vote, and ballot rolloff from presidential votes to votes in other statewide races.

There are three alternative solutions provided:

1. [R - tidyverse](https://burtmonroe.github.io/SoDA501/Exercise3-2018/TidyverseSolution/)
2. [R - data.table](https://burtmonroe.github.io/SoDA501/Exercise3-2018/data.tableSolution/)
3. Python - pandas
