# Exercise #1 - 2019 - Google Trends - Due Monday, Jan 14.


Consider the following search on Google Trends: https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&geo=US&q=islam (relative use of the search term "islam" in the US for all time available

<script type="text/javascript" src="https://ssl.gstatic.com/trends_nrtr/1671_RC04/embed_loader.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript"> trends.embed.renderExploreWidget("TIMESERIES", {"comparisonItem":[{"keyword":"islam","geo":"US","time":"2004-01-01 2019-01-07"}],"category":0,"property":""}, {"exploreQuery":"date=all&geo=US&q=islam","guestPath":"https://trends.google.com:443/trends/embed/"}); </script>

You can see what appears to be a seasonal pattern. I want you and your partner to discuss what you think the cause of that is and try to think of comparison search terms that would follow a related pattern if that were the cause. (It doesn't have to be identical ... you might think of something that should move in the opposite direction or be the same but shifted 3 months.) Does it look like you were right? Keep trying.

What I want you to turn in. A brief writeup (as little as a paragraph might do) giving your best explanation for the pattern, and a small set of comparison terms (1-4) that you think best support your case.
