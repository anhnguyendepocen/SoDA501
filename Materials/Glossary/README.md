**Big data**


**Computational social science**


**Curse of dimensionality**


**Data mining**


**Indirect effects**


**IR** Usually in this field "information retrieval." Also used for "international relations", "infrared"


**Linkage ("record linkage")**


**Map/reduce**


**Matching**


**Online** Could be used in regular meaning like "on the web" but can also be used like "streaming" as a modifier to "data" or "algorithm" or "processing" to indicate data is being processed sequentially, with one pass through the data, or even in real-time as data is generated.


**Social**


**Streaming / stream processing** Could be used in regular meaning like "streaming video" but can also mean data is being passed through an algorithm sequentially, with the algorithm updating after each observation.


**Transportability**


**Unfolding problem**


**"V"s of big data** Traditional "three Vs of big data" - volume, velocity, variety. There are many "fourth V's" including Monroe's "five Vs of big data social science"


**Variety** One of the conventional "three Vs" of "Big Data"



## Field terms

**Algorithmic confounding**


**Backpropagation**


**Bias-variance tradeoff**


**Causal effect**


**Cloud-edge interactions**


**Cross-validation**


**Data-intensive**


**De-anonymization**


**Drift**


**Formal theory** - used in political science to mean theorizing through mathematically coherent models ... usually means use of microeconomics-style models or game theory to model some political phenomenon. Main usage is to distinguish from another subfield of political science, political theory, which in most instances bears closer resemblance to philosophy than economics. 


**Grid computing**


**Hadoop**

**Natural language processing**


**NLP** (See "natural language processing")


**Nowcasting**


**Out-of-sample prediction**


**Provenance (of data)**


**Repurposing (of data)**


**User-attribute inference**


**Vinculation** - the tendency for social data to display interconnectedness (e.g., tied through network edges, exhibiting spatial correlation) that complicates inference and/or is itself the target of inference. Vinculated data may be small in N, but still require computationally intensive methods. One of Monroe's (2013) "five Vs." A [vinculum](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/vincula) is a "bond" or "tie"; used in anatomy, chemistry, and math.
