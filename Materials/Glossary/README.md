# SoDA 501 Glossary

> **Jingle-jangle fallacies** refer to the erroneous assumptions that two different things are the same because they bear the same name (jingle fallacy) or that two identical or almost identical things are different because they are labeled differently (jangle fallacy). <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jingle-jangle_fallacies>

**Formal theory** - used in political science to mean theorizing through mathematically coherent models ... usually means use of microeconomics-style models or game theory to model some political phenomenon. Main usage is to distinguish from another subfield of political science, political theory, which in most instances bears closer resemblance to philosophy than economics.

**Matching** In causal inference, matching is a process for analysis of observational data, under which treated units are matched with control units that are otherwise similar by some measure on observable pretreatment variables. In information sciences, matching is another term for "record linkage."

**Online** Could be used in regular meaning like "on the web" but can also be used like "streaming" as a modifier to "data" or "algorithm" or "processing" to indicate data is being processed sequentially, with one pass through the data, or even in real-time as data is generated.

**SGD** (see "stochastic gradient descent")


**Social**


**Social network** I'd prefer if this were only used to refer to networks in which the nodes are people or groups of people and the edges indicate some kind of "social" relationship. It is sometimes used in reference to networks more generally. It is also, of course, a term of art used to refer to social media sites or platforms, e.g., Facebook. 


**Split-Apply-Combine (SAC)**


**Statistical disclosure limitations**


**Stochastic gradient descent / SGD**


**Stratified sampling**


**Streaming / stream processing** Could be used in regular meaning like "streaming video" but can also mean data is being passed through an algorithm sequentially, with the algorithm updating after each observation.


**Test data / test set** (see "training data")


**Tidy data / tidyverse**


**Training data/set; test data/set; validation data/set**


**Transportability**


**Uncertainty**


**Unfolding** Lots of disciplines have something they call "unfolding" (e.g., music, biochemistry). Here, it's most likely to refer to a type of data analysis closely related to multidimensional scaling, which maps individuals and objects over which they have preferences in the same space. The next most likely usage is as "deconvolution", the reversing of a convolution operation.


**User-attribute inference**


**"V"s of big data** Traditional "three Vs of big data" - volume, velocity, variety. There are many "fourth V's" including Monroe's "five Vs of big data social science"


**Validation / validity**


**Variety** One of the conventional "three Vs" of "Big Data"


**Varimax**


**Vinculation** - the tendency for social data to display interconnectedness (e.g., tied through network edges, exhibiting spatial correlation) that complicates inference and/or is itself the target of inference. Vinculated data may be small in N, but still require computationally intensive methods. One of Monroe's (2013) "five Vs." A [vinculum](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/vincula) is a "bond" or "tie"; used in anatomy, chemistry, and math.
